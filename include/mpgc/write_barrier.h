   * The write barrier function that is called on reference update.
   * The barrier, in order to be atomic wrt. sync and async phases,
   * defers handshake in the beginning, does the barrier and reference
   * update and then checks if a handshake is pending.
   *
   * We take the pointers as generic offset_ptrs rather than
   * specifically pointing to const gc_allocated because at the point
   * the write_barrier is invoked (e.g., during an assignment), the
   * referened type may still be a forward declaration, and the
   * compiler won't be able to prove that it derives from
   * gc_allocated.  
   *
   * To make it more likely that the compiler will be willing to
   * inline this (and to avoid an explosion of out-of-line functions
   * when it isn't), we split the write barrier into two parts: a
   * prologue, which is called before the specific operation function,
   * and an epilogue, which is called after.  The prologue and
   * epilogue are non-templated.
